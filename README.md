SE-Topbar-MainMeta
==================

Userscript for adding back the [main] link into the new top bar design being tested on mSO.

Styles the bar as light (similar to the coloring before the beta). 
Overrides the hover styles to correlate with the light styling.

Side feature:
There is a side feature that I use in my userscript which I left in here.
It is a small ellipse on the top right hand (not visible if the window isn't scrolled).
Clicking it will cause the top bar to dock and essentially become position:fixed.
At that point the ellipse will change color, and a second click will undock the bar (position:relative) back to the top.
